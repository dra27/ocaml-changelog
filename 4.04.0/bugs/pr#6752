*PR#6752: Nominal types and scope escaping.
Revert to strict scope for non-generalizable type variables, cf. Mantis.
Note that this is actually stricter than the behavior before 4.03,
cf. PR#7313, meaning that you may sometimes need to add type annotations
to explicitly instantiate non-generalizable type variables.

 Nicolas Ojeda Bar and Alain Frisch)
