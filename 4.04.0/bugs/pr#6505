*PR#6505: Missed Type-error leads to a segfault upon record access.
Proper fix required a more restrictive approach to recursive types:
mutually recursive types are seen as abstract types (i.e. non-contractive)
when checking the well-foundedness of the recursion.
(Jacques Garrigue, extra report by Stephen Dolan)
