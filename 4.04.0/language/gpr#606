GPR#606: optimized representation for immutable records with a single
field, and concrete types with a single constructor with a single argument.
This is triggered with a [@@unboxed] attribute on the type definition.
Currently mutually recursive datatypes are not well supported, this
limitation should be lifted in the future (see PR#7364).
