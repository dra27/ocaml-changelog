GPR#247: In previous OCaml versions, inlining caused stack frames to
disappear from stacktraces. This made debugging harder in presence of
optimizations, and flambda was going to make this worse. The debugging
information produced by the compiler now enables the reconstruction of the
original backtrace. Use `Printexc.get_raw_backtrace_next_slot` to traverse
the list of inlined stack frames.
