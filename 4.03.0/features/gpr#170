*GPR#170: Parse arbitrary precision integers.
Accept a single [A-Za-z] as modifier for integers (generalizing 'l','L','n')
and floats.
May cause breakage (ie. ppx preprocessor) because of changes in the parsetree.
This changes PR#6816 a little bit by reading the literal [123a] as a single
token that can later be rewritten by a ppx preprocessor.
