PR#6902, GPR#210: emit a runtime warning on stderr when finalizing an I/O
channel which is still open:
  "channel opened on file '...' dies without being closed"
this is controlled by OCAMLRUNPARAM=W=1 or with Sys.enable_runtime_warnings.
The behavior of affected program is not changed,
but they should still be fixed.
