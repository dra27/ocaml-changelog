GPR#22: Fix the cleaning of weak pointers. In very rare cases
accessing a value during the cleaning of the weak pointers could
result in the value being removed from one weak arrays and kept in
another one. That breaks the property that a value is removed from a
weak pointer only when it is dead and garbage collected.
