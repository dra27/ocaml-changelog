PR#6220, PR#6403, PR#6437, PR#6801: Improved redundancy and exhaustiveness
checks for GADTs. Namely, the redundancy checker now checks whether the
uncovered pattern of the pattern is actually inhabited, exploding at most one
wild card. This is also done for exhaustiveness when there is only one case.
Additionally, one can now write unreachable cases, of the form
"pat -> .", which are treated by the redundancy check.
