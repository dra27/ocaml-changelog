PR#6583: add a new class of binary operators with the same syntactic
precedence as method calls; these operators start with # followed
by a non-empty sequence of operator symbols (for instance #+, #!?).
It is also possible to use '#' as part of these extra symbols
(for instance ##, or #+#); this is rejected by the type-checker,
but can be used e.g. by ppx rewriters.
