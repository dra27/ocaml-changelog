*PR#6019: more efficient implementation of caml_modify() and caml_initialize().
The new implementations are less lenient than the old ones: now,
the destination pointer of caml_modify() must point within the minor or
major heaps, and the destination pointer of caml_initialize() must
point within the major heap.

 Yaron Minsky and Gerd Stolpmann)
