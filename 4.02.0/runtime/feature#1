New configure option "-no-naked-pointers" to improve performance by
avoiding page table tests during block darkening and the marking phase
of the major GC.  In this mode, all out-of-heap pointers must point at
things that look like OCaml values: in particular they must have a valid
header.  The colour of said headers should be black.
